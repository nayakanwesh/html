    <h1 color="blue">HISTORY OF W3C</h1>
    <p>In 1989, <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/"tagent="_blank"><u>Tim Berners-Lee</u></a><br>
         invented the World Wide Web (see the original proposal).<br>
         He coined the term "World Wide Web," wrote the first World Wide Web server, "httpd," 
         and the first client program (a browser and editor), "WorldWideWeb," in October 1990.<br>
       <i> He wrote the first version of the "HyperText Markup Language" (HTML),</i> <br>
        the document formatting language with the capability for hypertext links that<br>
         became the primary publishing format for the Web. His initial specifications<br>
          for URIs, HTTP, and HTML were refined and discussed in larger circles as Web technology spread.</p>
